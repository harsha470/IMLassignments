Jade 735, Luxury Homestay,Bangalore,India,1,52453,DiningInternetOutdoor ActivitiesParking FacilityPower backupSwimming Pool,One of the most pathetic Resort one can experience!!. Staff behavior is horrible. Almost everything is untidy. The pool was dirty and they were cleaning it when we wanted to enter the pool. Worst maintece of a resort of such decoration.,TERRIBLE!!!! They charge exorbitant rates and offer a totally ** service. The staff aren't helpful at all and the food was below average. I'll never ever visit it nor will I recommend it to anyone else,,,,
